# 💫 About Me

**Systems Programming • Rust • Embedded • ARM64**

I’m a B.Tech student focused on low-level systems and performance-oriented software.  
I enjoy working close to the hardware—building embedded projects, exploring operating systems, and understanding how software interacts with silicon.

My current interests include **Rust**, **Embedded Systems**, and **ARM64 internals**, with a growing focus on systems design, networking, and OS fundamentals.  
I value clarity, efficiency, and learning by building real systems from the ground up.

---

## 🧠 What I Care About
- Low-level systems and operating system fundamentals  
- Writing efficient, minimal, and predictable code  
- Hardware–software interaction  
- Building systems that work close to the metal  

---

## 🔧 Currently Exploring
- Rust for systems and embedded development  
- ESP32 firmware, networking, and internals  
- ARM64 architecture and low-level programming  
- OS concepts: memory, scheduling, interrupts, I/O  

---

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here
- Experiments with **systems programming concepts**
- Embedded and microcontroller-based projects  
- Low-level Rust code and learning notes  
- Explorations into OS internals and architecture

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy
> *Understand the system.  
> Build it yourself.  
> Keep it simple and correct.*

I believe deep understanding comes from writing things from scratch, breaking them, and rebuilding them better.
