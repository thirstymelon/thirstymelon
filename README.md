## About

I'm a systems programmer focused on low-level software development and embedded systems. My work centers on understanding how systems operate from first principles and building solutions that are efficient, minimal, and predictable.

**Core Interests:**
- Low-level programming and systems design
- Embedded systems development
- Operating systems internals
- Hardware-software interfaces
- Networking fundamentals

**Primary Technologies:** Rust, Assembly | **Target Platforms:** ARM64, ESP32

## Development Philosophy

```rust
fn principles() -> [&'static str; 5] {
    [
        "Understand the system",
        "Build from first principles",
        "Break things to learn",
        "Keep it simple and correct",
        "Optimize only when needed"
    ]
}
```

> *"The best way to understand a system is to build it yourself."*
